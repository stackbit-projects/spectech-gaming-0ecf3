**SpecTech Gaming** is a Computer Gaming Hardware company established in [Carrickfergus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrickfergus), Northern Ireland. The beautiful, [Carrickfergus Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrickfergus_Castle), Can be seen above. 

**Daryl Moore**, The founder of SpecTech Gaming, an avid gamer who enjoyed building PCs as a hobby, spent many years in computer technology companies, searching for PC parts, knowledge and assistance in the world of PCs and gaming.

Daryl came to realise that the support for new PC gamers just wasn't available. 
Because of this, and seeing the opportunity to not only provide the insight, but also craft the systems for users, and provide information on the gaming world, he started SpecTech Gaming in the hopes of helping more people get started with PC gaming in the most informed and cost effective way, so he turned his focus to helping others who wanted to enter the world of PC gaming, but didn't have the knowledge to take the plunge for fear of selecting the wrong builds!
