**SpecTech Gaming** is a Computer Gaming Hardware company established in [Carrickfergus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrickfergus), Northern Ireland. [Carrickfergus Castle] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrickfergus_Castle) Can be seen above **Daryl Moore**, The founder of SpecTech Gaming had spent many years as an avid gamer and enjoyed building PCs

After working for many years in computer technology companies, and the onset of the Coronvirus, Daryl ended up becoming furlough from his own place of work. During this time he turned his focus to helping others who wanted to enter the world of PC gaming, but didn't have the knowledge to take the plunge for fear of selecting the wrong builds!

After many years of searching for parts, knowledge and assistance in the world of gaming, Daryl came to realise that the support for new PC gamers just wasn't available. 
Because of this, and seeing the opportunity to not only provide the insight, but also craft the systems for users, and provide information on the gaming world, he started SpecTech Gaming in the hopes of helping more people get started with PC gaming in the most informed and cost effective way.
